These are configuration files for the Android Multiling O Keyboard application. 

The "vanilla" file aims to be a _mostly_ faithful reproduction of the MessageEase keyboard laybout, but with a few tweaks. Most notably the enter and backspace keys are relocated.

The "anihurtes100" file is a larger modification with more significant changes. Specifically, the "space" character is put in the center for easier access and the letter O is moved down. Otherwise the basic layout of letters is unchanged.
